# The StoryGraph - Client

This is the frontend React application for The StoryGraph project. This client communicates with the backend server to provide a complete book tracking and discovery experience.

## Important Note

**This client application requires the backend server to be running simultaneously.** If you see a "No response from server. Make sure the server is running and try again" error when trying to sign in or access protected features, it means the backend server is not running.

### To run the complete application:

1. Start the backend server (from the root directory):
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   or
   ```
   npm start
   ```

2. Start this client application (from the client directory or root directory):
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   or from the root directory:
   ```
   npm run client
   ```

Both the server (on port 3001) and the client (on port 3000) must be running simultaneously for the application to work properly.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
